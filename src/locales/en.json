    "wpsFull": "EOS Worker Proposal System",
    "overviewP1": "The EOS Worker Proposal System (WPS) is a funding mechanism for the EOS Mainnet, enabling developers and other value creators to seek funding from the EOS blockchain for their projects outside of EOS block rewards. It’s modeled closely after the {dashNexus} which has been successfully funding projects benefiting the DASH ecosystem. It also pulls from our experience designing and maintaining the BOS Ecosystem Program. We’ve analyzed real node, developer, and token holder behaviour in both these systems over an extended period of time in order to design an improved version for the EOS Mainnet.",
    "dashProposalSystem": "DASH Budget Proposal System",
    "overviewP2": "This decentralized voting & distribution mechanism is governed by the rules coded within the WPS smart contracts, which allows any EOS account to propose a budget for their specific project and Block Producers elected by token holders to vote on them. Each proposal that passes is paid directly from the {eosio} account to the EOS account that proposed the work.",
    "votingPeriodsAndFunding": "Voting periods and funding",
    "votingPeriodsAndFundingP1": "A maximum budget of {maxMonthlyBudget} will be made available for each {votingPeriod}. The period budget and duration are settings within the WPS smart contract that can be adjusted by MSIG approval from 15 of the top 21 Block Producers.",
    "votingPeriod": "{days}-day voting period",
    "votingPeriodsAndFundingP2": "{eosio} is funded from the fees accumulated in the eosio.names and eosio.ramfee accounts prior to the deployment of REX. Prior to REX, these accounts accumulated roughly 3.5 million EOS from EOS premium name auctions and RAM purchase fees. These administrative fees were voluntarily collected from token holders by the network. It’s important to note these funds do not stem from inflation or taxation as they originate from services rendered by the network for specific individuals at their request. An MSIG approval from 15 of the top 21 Block Producers will be required to move funds to eosio.wps, and this will occur on an ongoing basis.",
    "votingPeriodsAndFundingP3": "Any ongoing fees being collected by `eosio.names` & `eosio.ramfee` will continue to flow to REX holders and shall not be transferred to `eosio.wps`. Funds flowing into REX will not be affected by this proposal.",
    "votingPeriodsAndFundingP4": "We’ll propose to transfer 50,000 EOS, or two periods worth, to the `eosio.wps` account upon activation of the EOS WPS system. We’ll propose a top-up of another {maxMonthlyBudget} one month ahead of each period. This gives the top 21 the flexibility to discontinue the WPS system at any time by simply not funding it.",

      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Who can participate in voting on EOS WPS proposals?",
        "answer": "Block Producers on the EOS Public Network who have met the 100 EOS/day reward threshold for at least 24 hours."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Why is there a {depositFee} fee to submit a proposal?",
        "answer": "To limit spam so that Block Producers can focus on reviewing only serious proposals."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Where does the {depositFee} fee go?",
        "answer": "The fee goes into the eosio.wps account to be redistributed to passing proposals."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Is the {depositFee} fee ever refunded?",
        "answer": "No, the fee is non-refundable once the proposal has been published. However, during the draft period of a proposal, the deposit of {depositFee} can be refunded."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Can my proposal be eligible for the next period if it does not meet the threshold in during the voting period it was published?",
        "answer": "No, if your proposal doesn’t pass in the period it was published, it is closed and not eligible for voting in the next period. If you’re publishing a proposal near the end of a period, consider waiting to publish it until the start of the next period."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "When will funds for passed proposals be transferred to the proposer?",
        "answer": "On closing of the voting period, EOS will be automatically transferred to proposers whose proposals have passed."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Can I request to be paid in Fiat or something other than EOS?",
        "answer": "No, budgets will only be paid in EOS."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Can I request payment in milestones, or does it need to be a lump sum?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can request to split your payment across a maximum of 6 {days}-day periods, coinciding with the voting periods. But payment is subject to continued voting for each period. Votes for multi-period proposals roll over to subsequent voting periods. Payment will only be transferred during periods where the proposal meets the proposal threshold. If threshold is not met during a period, the proposal will remain active for the next voting periods."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a fee for each voting period for my multi-period proposal?",
        "answer": "No, the {depositFee} fee paid to publish the proposal covers you for up to 6 periods."
      },
      "11": {
        "question": "Can I adjust my proposal after it has been published?",
        "answer": "No, a proposal can’t be changed after it’s been published."
      },
      "12": {
        "question": "What if the EOS price changes drastically? Can I edit my budget in that case?",
        "answer": "No, a proposal can’t be changed after it’s been published."
      },
      "13": {
        "question": "How much work can be expected to get a proposal funded?",
        "answer": "Data from other WPS shows that a lot of work is required to get a proposal funded. It is up to the proposer to seek and obtain votes on the proposal. The network does not provide guidance, nor guarantee, as to how to get funded."

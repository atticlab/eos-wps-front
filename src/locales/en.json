Itâ€™s modeled closely after the {dashNexus} which has been successfully funding projects benefiting the DASH ecosystem for over 5 years.",
    "dashProposalSystem": "DASH Budget Proposal System",
    "overviewP2": "This decentralized voting & distribution mechanism is governed by the rules coded within the WPS smart contracts, which allows any EOS account to propose a budget for their specific project and Block Producers elected by token holders vote on them. Each proposal that passes is paid directly from the {eosio} account to the EOS account that proposed the work.",

Prior to REX, these accounts accumulated roughly 3.5 million EOS from EOS premium name auctions and RAM purchase fees. An MSIG approval from 15 of the top 21 Block Producers is required to move those funds to eosio.wps. For now, MSIG proposals will be issued every 90 days to fund eosio.wps with enough EOS to cover 3 periods (150,000 EOS).",

      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Who can participate in voting on EOS WPS proposals?",
        "answer": "Block Producers on the EOS Public Network who have met the 100 EOS/day reward threshold for at least 24 hours."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Why is there a {depositFee} fee to submit a proposal?",
        "answer": "To limit spam so that Block Producers can focus on reviewing only serious proposals."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Where does the {depositFee} fee go?",
        "answer": "The fee goes into the eosio.wps account to be redistributed to passing proposals."

      "5": {
        "question": "Is the {depositFee} fee ever refunded?",
        "answer": "No, the fee is non-refundable."

      "6": {
        "question": "Can my proposal be eligible for the next period if it does not meet the threshold in during the voting period it was published?",
        "answer": "No, if your proposal doesnâ€™t pass in the period it was published, it is closed and not eligible for voting in the next period. If youâ€™re publishing a proposal near the end of a period, consider waiting to publish it until the start of the next period."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "When will funds for passed proposals be transferred to the proposer?",
        "answer": "On closing of the voting period, EOS will be automatically transferred to proposers whose proposals have passed."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Can I request to be paid in Fiat or something other than EOS?",
        "answer": "No, budgets will only be paid in EOS."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Can I request payment in milestones, or does it need to be a lump sum?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can request to split your payment across a maximum of 6 30-day periods, coinciding with the voting periods. But payment is subject to continued voting for each period. Votes for multi-period proposals roll over to subsequent voting periods. Payment will only be transferred during periods where the proposal meets the proposal threshold. If threshold is not met during a period, the proposal will remain active for the next voting periods."

      "10": {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a fee for each voting period for my multi-period proposal?",
